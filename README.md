# BlazorRockPaperScissors

## Summary
BlazorRockPaperScissors is a web-based implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, 
built using Blazor, a framework for building interactive web UIs with .NET. 

## Important Classes

### Game
The `Game` class handles the core logic of the Rock Paper Scissors game. It manages the game state, processes player moves, and determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

### Player
The `Player` class represents a player in the game. It stores information about the player's name and the move they have chosen (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).


This project serves as a fun and educational example of what can be achieved with Blazor and .NET 8, demonstrating the power and flexibility of modern web development with .NET technologies.
